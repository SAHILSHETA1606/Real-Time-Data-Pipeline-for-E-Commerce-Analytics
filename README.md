In todayâ€™s digital landscape, real-time data processing is essential for driving timely business decisions. This project showcases a comprehensive real-time data pipeline tailored for e-commerce analytics. Leveraging modern data engineering tools, the pipeline efficiently ingests, processes, stores, and visualizes clickstream and transactional data.

Built with a combination of Kafka, Apache Spark, Docker, Elasticsearch, and Kibana, this system enables end-to-end real-time analytics. Python is used extensively for scripting, data generation, and orchestration.

ðŸ”§ Key Components:
Data Generation: Synthetic e-commerce data is generated in real-time using the Faker library.

Kafka: Acts as the message broker for streaming real-time events.

Apache Spark: Processes the streaming data with low latency for real-time insights.

Elasticsearch: Stores the processed data for fast and flexible querying.

Kibana: Visualizes key business metrics and trends from the Elasticsearch indices.
